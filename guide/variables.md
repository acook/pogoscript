Variables can be declared like this:

    windSpeed = 25

Once declared, you can then reassign them using the `:=` operator:

    windSpeed := 13

There is another interesting thing about variables in Pogoscript, and that is that they can contains spaces. The above variable can also be written like this:

    wind speed = 25

This, as we'll see next, is useful when defining and calling functions.
