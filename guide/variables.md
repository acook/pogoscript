The first, most basic, and most surprising feature of the language is variables. In Pogoscript variable names can contain spaces, ala:

    wind speed = 25

Here we've declared and initialised a new variable called `wind speed`. And now we can assign a new value to it too:

    wind speed = 13

Variables can contain spaces, but the same variables can be written using camel case too and amount to the same thing:

    windSpeed
    => 13
